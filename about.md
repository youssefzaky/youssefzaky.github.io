I have close to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-zaky-955b17124/">decade</a> of experience in many areas of machine learning across multiple companies and industries. Expertise in computer vision (detection, segmentation, tracking, depth, 3D, multicamera geometry, action recognition), self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, robotics and control. I can rapidly prototype solutions based on existing literature or create novel adaptations of existing methods to suit a problem. I have experience in managing and leading ML teams, in product development, and in ML engineering using MLOps best practices.
